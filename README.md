# Search Algorithms for MC3 Problem
This repository contains implementations of search algorithms for solving the MC3 (Multi-objective Code Clone Configuration) problem.
Additionally, it includes various files related to Elasticsearch configurations, I/O operations, and other supporting resources.

## Table of Contents
- [Code](#code)
- [Datasets](#datasets)
- [Parameters](#parameters)

## Code
The `code` directory contains the implementations of various search algorithms used to solve the MC3 problem. These algorithms are written in Python and can be executed to find solutions for the problem.

## Datasets
The `datasets` directory contains the datasets used as oracles to validate the solutions generated by the search algorithms.
The data refers to code clones between the Stack Overflow and Qualtias corpus platforms.
In addition, it also has a 'download_links.txt' file that provides download links for Stack Overflow code snippets and Qualitas corpus projects.

## Parameters
In the `parameters` directory, you'll find files containing the values of search spaces used by the algorithms. These files provide the parameters necessary for configuring the search algorithms to explore different solution spaces efficiently.

## Examples
The `Examples.md` file has example clone links between Stack Overflow and the Qualitas corpus

## Computational Infrastructure
The `infrastructure.md` file contains a description of the infrastructure that were used to carry out our experiment.

## Tutorial to Execute
## Notes
- The project works exclusively for Ubuntu
- You can make project settings in the .env file
- If you want to do quick tests, use "mini_qualitas_corpus_clean" which is downloaded together with the other datasets.

### 0. Remove the need to use "sudo" command
Run the command "sudo visudo" and make the following changes
```bash
sudo visudo
```

Insert at the end of the file
```bash
<your-user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

### 1. Configure Java context to Siamese
```bash
chmod +x java-install.sh
./java-install.sh
```

### 2. Install and generate Siamese (.jar)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UCL-CREST/Siamese.git
cd Siamese
mvn compile package
cp -i target/siamese-0.0.*.jar .
```
Place the file in the "code" folde

### 3. install project dependencies to run the experiment
```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure your .env
Change the ".env_example" file to ".env".
You can use the default settings, or you can change the settings in this file.

### 5. Download Qualitas Corpus, StackOverflow and Elasticsearch datasets
```bash
python download_datasource.py
```

### 6. Execute Experiment
```bash
python main_exepriment.py
```
